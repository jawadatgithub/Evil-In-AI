## Intro

Go to google images and search for 'evil', what do you see? Read through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil

### Who created the evil?
Evil created by our creator (the creator of the whole universe).

### Why the creator created evil?
To test us, human have choice to do good or evil, so every choice made by an adult human its part of test.

### How human choose evil?
The only well-known Evil source is the devil (our creator declared the devil as the first common enemy for ALL humans).  
Whispering is devil method of attack, If human followed the whisper it will lead to evil. and gradually human Evil grow...

### Since AI is human creation, where the evil in AI will come from?!
Directly from us and indirectly by following the devil. So all crimes committed by Evil AI bounded to AI architect/designer/unethical hacker.

### Why there is no well-known or well-defined abstract dataset called evil-data?
Because there is no absolute evil in the universe, unless you want to make a simulation or clone of the devil "AI-Devil" then you could build data model for that based on how well you understand the devil...(I advise sincerely & humbly to stay away from the devil as our creator ordered us)  
One might argue that: we built alot of datasets for things not absolute? hmm, I don't know, but so far (to best of my knowledge) there is no open-data dictionary or database represents evil.
