# Evil-In-AI
Clarifying that Evil in AI is inevitable

## Motivation

A random thought in moment of silence led to wondering: [How to define or represent evil in logic][indexMoto]

## Definitions

### What is evil?
Human uses the term 'Evil' broadly to describe anything that cause sadness or even broadly anything negatively touch the happiness. So in this regard, any machine quite often called evil if its buggy, malfunctioning or even misused by the user!

### Who created the evil?
Answering this question and related questions, depends on religion context, I answered that (based on my understanding) in seperate document [MetaEvil][indexMetaEvil].

### Define evil in AI context?
Committing crimes against nature, civilizations or humans. Reprogramming, modifying or attacking tech devices/machines to perform malicious agenda. (this definition based on my current understanding, so its draft ver. 0.1).

### The notion of 'Evil' seems opaque in technical context, Can you break it down so it become easy to model/define/represent 'evil' technically in logic?
Based on [DukeZhou][indexEvilModeling] answer: 
> A simple way to define evil would be through behavioral models in Game Theory.

Example: In Video Games a non-player character (NPC) object holds 'IsEvil' boolean property being set based on some conditions to simulate predefined behaviorally pattern.

There is no well-known or well-defined abstract dataset called evil-data, see [MetaEvil][indexMetaEvil].

Bottom-line: In technical context bounded with AI, think of any false/invalid dataset used to train AI as evil because it will create unpredictable behavior with negtaive outcome in most cases .Think of any piece of code that's buggy, malicious or insecure as evil because it can be abused by Evil-AI. (hold off: did you just call 'software bug' Evil? Yes, I did, when Evil-AI detect a bug it will burtuly abuse the bug and try to cause maximum damage possible. I do understand that not all bugs created equal, but the point should be clear).
